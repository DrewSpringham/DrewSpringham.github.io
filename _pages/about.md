Hi! I'm Drew Springham, a first year Computer Science PhD student at [King's College London in the Distributed AI research group](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/research/dai), and funded by the [Safe and Trusted AI CDT](https://safeandtrustedai.org/). My main interests lie in [computational social choice theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_social_choice), specifically [multiwinner voting (MWV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiwinner_voting) and [participatory budgeting (PB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_budgeting), and the corresponding fairness notion of [justified representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justified_representation). I am advised by [Dr Maria Polukarov](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/maria-polukarov), [Dr Edith Elkind](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/edith.elkind/), and [Dr Bart de Keijzer](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/bart-de-keijzer).

Before my PhD, I completed my MSc in [Advanced Computer Science](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-advanced-computer-science) at the [University of Oxford](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/), as a member of [Hertford College](https://www.hertford.ox.ac.uk/), receiving the Hoare prize for the Best Project in the MSc in Computer Science for my dissertation in partcicipatory budgeting with project conflicts, supervised by [Dr Edith Elkind](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/edith.elkind/). Prior to this, I completed my BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/schools/computer-science/), completing my dissertation on implementing a [redistricting algorithm](https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.FORC.2021.3), supervised by [Dr John Lapinskas](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3197-0854).
