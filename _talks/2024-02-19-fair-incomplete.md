Multiwinner elections describes a form of election in which multiple candidates form the outcome instead of a single candidate. Such elections are relevant when electing a committee or a parliament. We study multiwinner voting in the scenario where we do not have full information about all votersâ€™ preferences. This could be useful in the scenario where eliciting the preferences of a whole electorate is infeasible for example.

We define the notion of approximate representation for forms of justified representation and provide bounds on the sample size of a population required to provide approximate representation.

Finally, we simulate such a sampling process on a real-world election instance and provide evidence for the practicality of such a process.
