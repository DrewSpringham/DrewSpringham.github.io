In the last decade we have seen an increase in the number of cities around the world turning to it's residents to democratically decide how to allocate local budgets. In this talk, we shall discuss the mathematical theory behind voting and discuss how we define fairness formally. A method for guaranteeing fair results for multiwinner elections will be presented, when the decision mechanism does not have full information about voters preferences. Finally, the results of a simulation will be presented which indicates this method may perform well in practice.
